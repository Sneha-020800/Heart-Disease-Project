# ❤ Heart Disease Project

This project explores and analyzes a heart disease dataset using *Python* and *Jupyter Notebook*.  
The goal is to perform *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*, create visualizations, and gain insights into factors that may influence the likelihood of heart disease.

## 📂 Project Structure
- Heart_Disease_Project.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations.  
- heart_disease_dataset.xlsx → Dataset used for analysis.  

## ⚙ Installation & Requirements
To run this project locally, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

Required libraries:

Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

▶ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Heart-Disease-Project.git

2. Open the folder in Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the notebook Heart_Disease_Project.ipynb step by step.

📊 Analysis Workflow

1. Data Loading

Read the dataset from Excel into a pandas DataFrame.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checking missing values, data types, and summary statistics.

Understanding distributions of key features.

3. Data Visualization

Histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Comparing patterns between patients with and without heart disease.

4. Insights

Identifying key factors related to heart disease occurrence.

📸 Example Visualizations

Age distribution of patients

Chest pain type vs Heart Disease

Correlation heatmap of all features
